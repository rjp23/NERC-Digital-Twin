    excerpt: "We will deploy our Digital Twin as a web-based application using deployed on the JASMIN Cloud infrastructure. Users will be able to, at the simple click of a button, simulate soil moisture time series over continental Africa. Flexibility will allow simulations for either the recent historical period, driven by TAMSAT rainfall data, or over the next century based on a range of ISIMIP climate scenarios."
