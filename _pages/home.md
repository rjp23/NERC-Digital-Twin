intro: 
  - excerpt: 'This project brings together scientists from [NCEO](https://www.nceo.ac.uk/), [NCAS](https://ncas.ac.uk/) and the [UK Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/climate/met-office-hadley-centre/index) along with expertise on data and IT infrastructure from [CEDA](https://www.ceda.ac.uk/) and [STFC](https://dafni.ac.uk/) in order to further develop and deploy an innovative Digital Twin application aimed at providing decision support related to African drought.'

    excerpt: "We will deploy our Digital Twin as a web-based application on the JASMIN Cloud infrastructure. Users will be able to, at the simple click of a button, simulate soil moisture time series over continental Africa. Flexibility will allow simulations for either the recent historical period, driven by TAMSAT rainfall data, or over the next century based on a range of ISIMIP climate scenarios."
